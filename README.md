## Information
This is a project completed for CSCI1300: UI/UX at Brown University. It demonstrates a React app that implements a list aggregation system. The specific functionality is one that allows users to allocate members of Gendo Taiko to songs in their repertoire; this is helpful to use when allocating members to a song for a performance.
